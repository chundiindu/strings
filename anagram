Given two stringsaandbconsisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.



class Solution
{    
    //Function is to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    public static boolean isAnagram(String a,String b)
    {
      char[] ch = a.toCharArray();
      char[] ch1 = b.toCharArray();
      Arrays.sort(ch);
      Arrays.sort(ch1);
      a=new String(ch);
      b=new String(ch1);
      return a.equals(b);
            
            
        }
    }
